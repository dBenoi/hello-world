# hello-world

My first repository.

# Learning git
I am completely new to git, minus pulling others open-source to my linux machines.

I am very excited to start using git and build my repo repertoire!

# Pull Requests
I guess I don't fully comprehend branches or pull requests.

Can I merge my branch into my "main"
